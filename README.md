# Dice Game ðŸŽ²   

The **Dice Game** is an interactive console-based program where a user plays a dice game against the computer. The program uses HMAC for ensuring fair play and includes advanced features like calculating probabilities, displaying helpful tables, and dynamic dice selection.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against the computer in a strategic dice game.
- **Fair Randomness**: Ensures fairness using cryptographic HMAC for random number generation.
- **Probability Calculation**: Displays a table showing the win probability for different dice configurations.
- **Dynamic Dice Configuration**: Supports custom dice configurations entered as arguments during program execution.
- **Help System**: Provides help and explanations during the game.

## Running the Game

### Syntax
To start the game, use the following command:
```bash
dotnet run <dice1> <dice2> <dice3> ...
```
- Replace `<dice1>`, `<dice2>`, etc., with your dice configurations, each consisting of exactly six integers separated by commas.

### Example
```bash
dotnet run 2,2,4,4,9,9 6,8,1,1,8,6 7,5,3,7,5,3
```

In the above example:
- The first dice has faces: `2, 2, 4, 4, 9, 9`
- The second dice has faces: `6, 8, 1, 1, 8, 6`
- The third dice has faces: `7, 5, 3, 7, 5, 3`
